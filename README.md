Hello Everyone From Distant Future,

This is an important message that there must have been a lot of changes in future since the time i'm writing this message. 
Currently I am in love with Python, R, SQL, and whatever tools or languages I'm coming across to learn about Machine Learning and Data-Science. 
If you're reading this, I am not sure what drastic changes must have been around that time and how do the things must be. Still I am hoping that humanity has learned an important lesson till that time to save the planet and use technology for betterment of human beings, solve complex problems and try to keep things as simple as possible. 
This is what I am aiming for, to make a dent in an universe till I am alive. Let's hope I would've reached some part of this goal by the time you are reading this. Thank you for landing by here. All the best to you and Cheers!!
